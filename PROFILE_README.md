# Nihal Veeramalla

Engineer building AI-first commerce and automation products: OCR/CV pipelines, LLM agents, and reliable APIs.

## What I build
- Retail computer vision: detection + OCR → structured catalog data, pricing, and clean hero assets.
- Agentic automation: MCP/LLM workflows for email/WhatsApp ops, approvals, and data extraction.
- Robust services: FastAPI/Node backends with Postgres/pgvector powering production data flows.

## Current focus
- Supplier-ready procurement automation with allocations and PO PDFs.
- Intelligent email agent that classifies intents, drafts replies, and generates resumes.
- Next-gen catalog pipeline with OCR, barcode reads, and high-quality hero imagery.

## Selected work
- [automatic-product-creator-pos-erp](https://github.com/nihal-5/automatic-product-creator-pos-erp) — YOLO + EasyOCR pipeline producing catalog JSONs and hero images.
- [Resource-procurement-automation-from-supplier](https://github.com/nihal-5/Resource-procurement-automation-from-supplier) — deterministic planner + FastAPI UI for supplier POs and branch allocations.
- [My-Email-MCP](https://github.com/nihal-5/My-Email-MCP) — MCP-driven email/WhatsApp agent with job detection and resume generation.
- [Text-Summarizer-Project](https://github.com/nihal-5/Text-Summarizer-Project) — production-ready abstractive summarization service.
